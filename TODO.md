- [ ] error report tool
- [ ] implement the sign message with blockhash of last 255 block to perform a sneak attack/gifting before reveal time is open to everyone (allowing plausible deniability until that point : I reveal my secret to my so called "allies" so they know I am sending them gift, but just before reveal of gifting is allowed by anyone, I send a signed message making the attack, 10 minute before)
- [ ] sending fleet flow, show queueReveal progress and error
- [ ] when revealTIme come check agent-service for registered queueID and show broadcast status
- [ ] Optimistic agent-serve registration and topups (later we could use pendingAction system)
- [ ] SHow list of fleets on agent-service page and allow to register them each or all

# ISSUES

- [ ] when not signed in, cannot acknowledge error or event: need to either force sign-in to see (same as fleets) orat least bring a popup to sign-in
